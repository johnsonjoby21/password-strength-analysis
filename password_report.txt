PASSWORD STRENGTH EVALUATION REPORT

Objective:
To understand what makes a password strong and evaluate different passwords using an online password strength checker.

Tool Used:
Kaspersky Password Strength Checker (https://password.kaspersky.com)

Passwords Tested:

1) Password: johnson123
Strength: Weak
Reason:
- Contains a common name
- Predictable number sequence
- Short length
- Vulnerable to dictionary attack

2) Password: Johnson@2024
Strength: Medium
Reason:
- Contains uppercase and symbol
- Still predictable (name + year)
- Could be guessed using personal information

3) Password: J0hN$0n!Sec#2024
Strength: Strong
Reason:
- Mixed uppercase, lowercase
- Includes numbers and symbols
- Longer length
- Harder to guess

4) Password: 9vT!rQ#7mZ@Lp$4x
Strength: Very Strong
Reason:
- Completely random
- High complexity
- Long length
- Resistant to brute force attacks

Common Password Attacks:

1. Brute Force Attack:
   Attacker tries all possible combinations.
   Short passwords are easily cracked.

2. Dictionary Attack:
   Attacker uses list of common words.
   Simple passwords like "password123" are vulnerable.

3. Credential Stuffing:
   Using leaked passwords from other sites.

Key Learnings:

- Length is more important than complexity alone.
- Avoid personal information.
- Use random combinations.
- Use password managers.
- Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

Conclusion:

Strong passwords must be long, random, and unpredictable.
Using password managers and multi-factor authentication greatly improves security.
